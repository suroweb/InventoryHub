### 5.5 Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Competitive Response (Medium Probability, High Impact)**
- **Scenario:** TradeGecko/Zoho launches AI features within 12 months
- **Mitigation:**
  - First-mover advantage: 12-18 month lead time
  - Patent AI forecasting algorithms (provisional patent filed)
  - Build brand as "AI inventory pioneer"
  - Focus on database-per-tenant security (harder to copy)

- **Scenario:** Churn exceeds 5% monthly (current assumption: 3%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement customer success team (hire Month 6)
  - Proactive outreach at churn risk signals (usage drop, support tickets)
  - Annual contracts with 10% discount (locks in customers)
  - High switching costs (data migration complexity)

**Risk 4: Slow Free-to-Paid Conversion (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)**
- **Scenario:** Conversion rate <15% instead of 25%
- **Mitigation:**
  - A/B test onboarding flows continuously
  - Implement usage-based pricing (pay for what you use)
  - Offer concierge onboarding for high-value prospects
  - Tighten free tier limits (50 products instead of 100)
